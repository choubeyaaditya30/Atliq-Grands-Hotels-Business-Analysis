# Atliq-Grands-Hotels-Business-Analysis
As part of the [CodeBasics](https://codebasics.io/) resume Challenge, I've created this Dashboard which will give us key insights and is very interactive.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands, a luxury hospitality company with multiple five-star hotels across India, has experienced a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel sector due to competitive strategic moves and
ineffective management decisions. To regain its competitive edge, AtliQ Grands aims to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence." Lacking an in-house data analytics team, they have enlisted a 3rd party service provider for 
insights based on historical data.

## Task List

Define and compute metrics based on the provided metric list to help management understand key performance indicators (KPIs).
### 2. Dashboard Development:
Design a dashboard according to the provided mock-up, ensuring a user-friendly and insightful interface for decision-makers.

### 4. Documentation and Delivery:
Summarize findings, methodology, and conclusions to deliver a comprehensive report for AtliQ Grandsâ€™ management team.
